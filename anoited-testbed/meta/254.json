I need to think a bit more about why the rsqrt of near-0 yields wildly varying things on both sides.<br>- Two hours of Client B work.<br>- Wrapped presents.<br>- Got my add-on podcast feed generator generating xml.</div>\n\n  </li>","postedSingleVideoPage":true},{"caption":"Sous vide: It doesn’t look very attractive","mediaFilename":"2BC42DA8-239E-48C1-BF76-EB3E677BB252.jpeg","altText":"Sous vide: It doesn’t look very attractive","id":"deathmtn-WebvYsys","date":"2021-12-24T20:34:35.466Z","postedToPersistence":true,"htmlFragment":"<li class=\"pane\">\n    \n  <div class=\"time-stamp entry-meta\">\n    <a href=\"deathmtn-WebvYsys.html\">\n      <time datetime=\"2021-12-24T20:34:35.466Z\">12/24/2021, 3:34:35 PM</time>\n    </a>\n  </div>\n  <img src=\"media/2BC42DA8-239E-48C1-BF76-EB3E677BB252.jpeg\" alt=\"Sous vide: It doesn’t look very attractive\"></img>\n<div class=\"media-caption entry-meta\">Sous vide: It doesn’t look very attractive</div>\n  </li>","postedSingleVideoPage":true},{"caption":"I think there’s a common belief that action games appeal to kids more than tactics games, but today, the guy bailed on Rogue Legacy because of the fine motor coordination needed to serial downthrust, but he had a great time with Into the Breach because you get all this time to think about what you want to do, and then do it without having to be great at timing.","id":"deathmtn-imHGJEPM","date":"2021-12-25T00:48:40.248Z","postedToPersistence":true,"htmlFragment":"<li class=\"pane\">\n    \n  <div class=\"time-stamp entry-meta\">\n    <a href=\"deathmtn-imHGJEPM.html\">\n      <time datetime=\"2021-12-25T00:48:40.248Z\">12/24/2021, 7:48:40 PM</time>\n    </a>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"text-caption\">I think there’s a common belief that action games appeal to kids more than tactics games, but today, the guy bailed on Rogue Legacy because of the fine motor coordination needed to serial downthrust, but he had a great time with Into the Breach because you get all this time to think about what you want to do, and then do it without having to be great at timing.</div>\n\n  </li>","postedSingleVideoPage":true},{"caption":"Had to send a message to Steam support today:<blockquote>Hi, I bought Samorost 2 over a year ago.
