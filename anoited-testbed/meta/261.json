I was concerned about how much time driving out there was going to cost us, but a lot of it was salvageable.<br>- Searching for something that I didn't understand in the pd code lead me to the resynthesis example patch, which has a comment in it that explains that the overlapping happens on block intake as well as on output. That was enough for me to understand that my implementation in the C++ vocoder was completely wrong. (It was only making output blocks overlap after generating them, which in retrospect, is really problematic because it will make the whole thing shorter). I implemented it so that the samples it picks up each block will contain some samples from the previous block — overlapping, if you will. It's still not done, but it sounds much smoother now.<br>- Now the problem at hand is why the carrier signal doesn't come out as much. I found a bug (int instead of float) that made a rounding thing in my code never run. Fixing that made the result of an rsqrt on the carrier fft result much closer to the one that pd gets.
