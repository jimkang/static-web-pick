My first idea was to use my cool vertical barrier wand to keep them back, but they could shoot through the barrier, even if they couldn't pass it themselves.<br><br>Then, I decided to take shots then retreat into the shaft that drops into the Snowy Depths because it's narrow, and my bouncy beam could cover a lot of it. It did kill some of them, but it also attracted more of them.<br><br>So, I started retreating further into the Holy Mountain ruins, but I got cornered and lost my extra life. I did win but was hurt badly, then got killed by the first guy who found me after the standoff.
