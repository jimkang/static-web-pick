{"caption":"My second Synthruary song is Message from Afar. It's another low song. I made a <a href=\"https://github.com/jimkang/pd-playground/blob/main/patches/synth2.pd\">simple instrument</a> that shifted the pitch by amount depending on the note in the sequence. It also delayed by an amount based on its position in the sequence. So, it was quite chaotic, though I didn't feel it was completely unrelated to what I was playing on the guitar. I did want a more complex sound than some offset sinusoids, but I had enough trouble as it was.","mediaFilename":"Message from Afar.mp3","altText":"My second Synthruary song is Message from Afar.
