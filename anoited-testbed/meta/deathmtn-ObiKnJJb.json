My first idea was to use my cool vertical barrier wand to keep them back, but they could shoot through the barrier, even if they couldn't pass it themselves.<br><br>Then, I decided to take shots then retreat into the shaft that drops into the Snowy Depths because it's narrow, and my bouncy beam could cover a lot of it.
