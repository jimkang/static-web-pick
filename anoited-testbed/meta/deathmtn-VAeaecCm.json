{"caption":"This is Two Robots Loitering at Guitar Center.<br><br>I wrote it via <a href=\"https://github.com/jimkang/midimod/blob/main/tools/micromodes.js\">this script</a>, which picks progressions, then modes, and fills them out with riffs and lead phrases that fit those modes. (I tried out sometimes doing some Slayer-style chaos soloing, but I learned you need a human to do that. Or better programming.) It took way longer to get working than I expected, derailing my Synthruary a bit.<br><br>Once I had the midi files generated to my liking, I put them in NanoStudio with guitar and bass virtual instruments on them. Even though I know all synths that try to sound like guitars with distortion are terrible, I gave them a shot.<br><br>Then, it occurred to me that clean guitar synths are OK, and I could use renderings with those synths as direct input to an amp modeler. It worked! It doesn't sound totally human (but I could get closer with some changes), but I now have a way of making generative guitar music.","mediaFilename":"Two Robots Loitering at Guitar Center.mp3","altText":"This is Two Robots Loitering at Guitar Center.<br><br>I wrote it via <a href=\"https://github.com/jim","isAudio":"true","id":"deathmtn-VAeaecCm","date":"2022-02-11T20:08:34.637Z"}
