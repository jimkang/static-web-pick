So, basically, a dungeon with jet packs and radiation.<br><br>The guy hit 0 hp in the first twenty minutes by continually trying to open a box while some tough space pirates attacked him. (In the games with him, when you hit 0 hp, you just lose all of your stuff and wake up in a jail, video game-style.) I don’t think he’s great at making hp projections based on average damage rates right now.<br><br>His guy woke up in a prison tube, broke out to find himself in a locked room, then hid in a secret ceiling compartment.<br><br>Then, when the space pirates came in to check on him, he cast Disguise Self to appear to be Ninja, one of the space pirates, then walked out with them.<br><br>He ditched the space pirates by running across a chasm on a spider web (evading the phase spider on it), got beat up some by a blob monster, then helped an alien scavenger cross the bridge above the spider by once again exploiting his Ninja disguise to dismiss the space pirates collecting tolls on the bridge.<br><br>He’s still really excited about things like finding a locked door with a green slot and unlocking it by putting in a green keycard. So, I don’t have to work all that hard on the mysteries. ","mediaFilename":"3EDD8001-C3E1-4EF0-94F0-C70180BAA9C5.jpeg","altText":"We played a D&D adventure set on another planet, as he requested.
