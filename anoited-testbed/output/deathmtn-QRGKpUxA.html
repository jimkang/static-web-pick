<div class="media-caption entry-meta">Counterintuitively, Christmas is a time where we have a lot of time to myself because the guy is absorbed with his puzzles and Lego, so I thought I'd take advantage of it by working on my vocoder more.<br><br>I got to the point at which I realized that the two versions come up with extremely different results for inverse square roots of the same near-zero values. I did some hacking to make the C++ version more like the pd version. It didn't help, and I felt really tired.<br><br>So, I went onto GOG and bought Noita, then got it running via Wine and got the Switch controller working with Ubuntu.<br><br>It's pretty cool, even though I'm sure it's running slow for me.<br><br>In the first 19 seconds of my second run, I blew myself up with a bomb wand, but also saw a subterranean passage when I went into the divot caused by the bomb.<br><br>Then, I used the bomb wand again to try to blow up a path down to the passage, but I didn't go far enough away when I threw a rock at my bomb and died.</div>
