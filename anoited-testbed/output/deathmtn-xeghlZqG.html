<div class="media-caption entry-meta">I started with a bomb wand as usual, then found another one right away near the entrance of the Mines. So, I decided to bomb some stuff I normally run past and discovered that there was an Outside part that I could get to with a little more bombing. So, there is in fact Outside both to the left (which is easy to get to) and to the right of the starting spot.<br><br>(I'm going to post this set in reverse chronological order for the benefit of those scrolling down.)</div>
